what would you recommend that i use to keep customer 8039230738 to buy more


For November 2024, I need a comprehensive overview:
What was the total number of unique orders placed?
What was the total sales value (Redistribution Value)?
Who was our best-performing salesman by total sales value? Please provide their name and the exact value they generated.



Now, lets look at October 2024. Identify the best-performing salesman based on both total sales value and the total number of orders. Provide their name, the precise total sales value, and the exact count of orders they processed.


Show me the top 5 brands by Redistribution Value across the entire dataset. Can you also visualize this data clearly as a horizontal bar chart for easy comparison?


I need to understand the monthly trend of Total_Amount_Spent for our top 3 brands (based on overall Redistribution Value) over the entire data period (August 2024 to January 2025). Please plot this as a line chart, ensuring each brand has its own distinct line.


Are there any brands that experienced a significant month-over-month drop in Redistribution Value (e.g., more than 15%) in the last three months of the dataset (November 2024, December 2024, January 2025)? If so, provide the brand names and their respective percentage drops.


What are the top 10 most frequently co-purchased SKU_Code pairs in our dataset? Please present this as a horizontal bar chart showing the pairs and their co-occurrence counts.


Provide a comprehensive purchase profile for customer with phone number 8060733751. This report should include:
Their total unique brands bought.
A list of all unique SKUs they have purchased.
A summary of their purchases by brand, detailing the last purchase date and total amount spent for each brand.
Identify their most frequently associated salesperson.


For customer 9016204667, what are the top 3 SKUs they are heuristically predicted to purchase next, based on their past buying patterns? For each prediction, include the predicted purchase date, the expected quantity, and the expected spend.


Generate personalized SKU recommendations for customer 8036906036. I need to see both their previously purchased SKUs and the top 5 recommended SKUs along with their similarity scores.


Who are the top 3 salesmen by Total_Amount_Spent across all branches for the entire dataset? Provide their names and their exact total sales figures.


I need a cross-tabulation showing the count of Order_Id for each Salesman_Name per Branch. This will help me understand sales distribution and identify any regional performance disparities.



Plot the monthly Total_Amount_Spent for our top 5 salesmen (by overall value) from August 2024 to January 2025. Use a line chart with each salesman as a separate line.


Give me a complete, high-level overview of our sales data, focusing on key insights and actionable recommendations. This should cover top-performing brands, customer lifetime value, and significant co-purchase patterns. I want a summary that I can present to the board.
